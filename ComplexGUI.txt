Use Vector to store SelectedOption

{
	number selected,
	menu viewer
}

Vector:
{
	{
		1,
		viewMainMenu,
		handleMainMenu
	},
	{
		0,
		viewActionMenu,
		handleActionMenu
	},
	{
		0,
		???
	}
}

MenuOption [
	Use a switch statement with numbers for it
	Each statement will have instructions in each
	We can have smaller methods
]

Smaller Methods:

Yes | No : Keys [A, D, LEFT, RIGHT]

Enter String : Keys [A-Za-z0-9]

Enter Number : Keys [0-9]

With this custom menu, we dont have to use std::cin! or another loop that captures characters


You can extend the MenuOption class implement its virtual functions

This would simplify the Application class
